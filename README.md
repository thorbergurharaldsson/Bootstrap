# HTML & CSS - Tooling/Bootstrap

This is a bootsrap website that I made following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s).

I used Bootstrap 5 with the CDN.  I used some components from the Bootstrap documentation but I also styled the website with Bootstrap classes.


Not having to write the CSS form the ground up is a huge time saver and I really like this process.
